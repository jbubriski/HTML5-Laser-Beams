# HTML5 Canvas Drawing Example

This is a just a simple example project with some moving shapes and some lines that are dynmaically drawn.  I called the lines laser beams, but they're more like tractor beams (that don't actually pull).

## Demo

## Credit

Some of the code, mainly the requestAnimFrame animation code, was taken from example on the [HTML5 Canvas Tutorials website](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com).
